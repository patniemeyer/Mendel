# Mendel

This is an update / partial rewrite of [Mendel](https://github.com/saniul/Mendel) by [Saniul](https://github.com/saniul).  I've ported it to Swift 4.2, done some cleanup, fixed some bugs, added a more minimal example (number summation), and made a Pod for it.

This is still a work in progress.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

Mendel is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Mendel', :git => 'https://github.com/patniemeyer/Mendel.git'
```
